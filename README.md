# Mobile application for a susteinable lifestyle
This project was created with the aim of building a phone app adhering to part of the European Commission's Agenda 2023 goals. 
It was born as the final project of a final year course of the master's degree in bioengineering, so much of the project actually lives in a fictitious environment, simulated for our purposes.

In particular, the app fits into goals 3,13, and 15, all of which are connected more or less directly with the theme of the relationship between man and the planet. 
That is why this application is designed to reward a healthy lifestyle through (simulated) efforts to plant trees in deforested areas. Motivation is given through the ability to keep track of one's weekly data (steps,workouts...) and with it derive what we have called the 'sustainability level' (LoS). In addition, the app allows you to receive daily tips on how to be more sustainable and attentive to the needs of the flood: tips ranging from simple information to real sustainable recipes!
The aim is to create an environment where well-being, sustainability and good habits are one.

From a technical point of view, this project makes full use of the Flutter development environment (Dart-based). Internal university APIs are used to receive the (real) data on the recorded activities via a smarthwatch. The application clearly ensures integrity, persistence and effective data management, as well as data visualisation and processing.

This project would not have been possible without the help of two precious collaborators: Filippo Carraro and Khouloud Dabussy, whom I thank with affection.
